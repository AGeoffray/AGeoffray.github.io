            <p>The domestic dog is a subspecies of wolf. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely
                attuned to human behavior, and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate
                for other canid species. New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic
                regions in humans where changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced
                intelligence.
                Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.</p>

        <p>Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs
            have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs), hunting (hounds, pointers), and rodent control
            (terriers). Other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs, detection dogs trained to detect
            illicit drugs or chemical weapons; guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs
            that pull loads. In 1957, the dog Laika became the first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the
            Soviets' Sputnik 2; she died during the flight.</p>

        <p>Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance
            dogs, and psychiatric service dogs provide assistance to individuals with disabilities. Some dogs owned by
            epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure,
            sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.</p>
